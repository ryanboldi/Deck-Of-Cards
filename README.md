# Deck of cards class

### This Repository contains a few seperate files:

#### **DeckofCards.py**
*This is a class file with two separate classes, Deck of cards, and Card. Putting these two classes together and using them together will help me very closely simulate what it's like to use a deck of cards.*

#### **Magic21.py**
*Python program that performs a magic trick to the user, the magic trick is self working, so it can be easily performed without a physical deck of cards*



## Tasks 
- [x] Add random card adding functions the Deck of cards class
- [ ] Add Shuffling mechanics to the Deck of cards class (riffle and faro)
- [ ] Add a second magic trick (5 card)
